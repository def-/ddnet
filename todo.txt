- viewport & scissor on fly changes (distinct the pipelines better for faster non clipped rendering)
- implement remaining render* calls (quads and streamed tiles missing)
- dynamic descriptor pool allocations when needed (maybe smaller pool sizes)
- implement texture destroy correctly (descriptors missing)
- v-sync not working? (or just radv bug?)
- implement new command buffer commands in OpenGL backend
- disallow alpha textures (new cmd for text textures)
- screenshots and video recorder not working
- decide on a heap
- check other swap chain images, if finished to free resources faster
- compile shaders in cmake ( https://gist.github.com/evilactually/a0d191701cb48f157b05be7f74d79396 )
